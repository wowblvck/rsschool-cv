### **About Me**
At school I played GTA SA Multiplayer and at the same time wrote servers in the PAWN programming language (similar to C).

Graduated from Kuban State Technological University with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. I have been working for 7 years in the field of design and development of equipment for nuclear power plants.

I came to RSS because I want to get knowledge in programming, as it seems to me that I am not doing my job.
